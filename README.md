# XcodeQuizTicTacToe
A Swift tic tac toe iOS game with a quiz side game

A twist on the traditional Swift tic tac toe tutorial.

You start off with a standard tic tac toe game, but if the player wins at tic tac toe, the player then has to answer a multiple 
choice question to gain the point.

If the question is answered correctly the game goes back to the tic tac toe board and adds a point to the score board.

Added Features-
Score board
Multiple Choice Quiz
Music Player
Delay Timer
